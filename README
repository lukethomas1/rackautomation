START STEPS:

1. Create cloud instances on rackspace (NECESSARY)
- Can use command "python3 index.py", will prompt for a save file created from
  web app, which will then automatically generate the number of nodes necessary

- Can use "integrated.sh createinstances" method, must input number
  of nodes

- Will take some time (~5 minutes)


2. Run iplist.sh (NECESSARY)
- This writes to ~/.ssh/config and pssh-hosts.txt

- Should take no longer than a couple seconds


3. Start emane on each cloud instance on rackspace (NECESSARY)
- "./integrated.sh emane_start '# of nodes' 'emane folder #'"

- Folder # is located on each cloud instance at ~/GrapeVine

- Ex. "./integrated.sh emane_start 13 13" (13 nodes, folder number 13)


4. Synchronize cloud instances time (NECESSARY)
- "./integrated.sh synchronize"


5. Start GrapeVine on cloud instances (NECESSARY)
- "./start_emane_java_10_rack.sh"

- Must have setup_emane_java_10_rack.sh and start_emane_java_10_rack.sh in the
  same folder


6. Success! You should now be able to send messages between nodes.


STOP STEPS:

1. To collect EMANE statistics after sending messages with GrapeVine use
   "./integrated.sh emanestat '# of nodes'"


2. To import EMANE statistics to GvineStatisticDatabase and copy emane statistic
table to the common folder: (./integrated  logfilecopy   “number of nodes”
imports the drop packet time to sql db), imports the emane stats to common
directory

3. To download all statistics and log files to your local machine : (./integrated
get  “complete path to the destination folder”. 

4. To stop EMANE (./integrated  emane_stop  “EMANE folder number”)

5. To delete files and wipe out the system to start new run: ( ./integrated
delete  “EMANE folder number”)

6. TO PLOT run query.py -> merge.py
