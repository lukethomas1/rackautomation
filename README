Description: README for rackspace + emane testing


START STEPS:

1. Create cloud instances on rackspace
- Command: "python3 racksuite.py init"
- Will prompt for a save file created from web app, then
  automatically generate the number of nodes necessary
- Will take some time (~5 minutes)

2. Setup topography configuration
- Command: "python3 racksuite.py setup"
- Will automatically generate the topography and distribute to rackspace nodes
- Will take about a minute

3. Start Emane and GrapeVine on each cloud instance on rackspace 
- Command: "python3 racksuite.py start"
- Will automatically start emane on each rackspace node
- May take up to 30 seconds before nodes can ping eachother

4. Success! You should now be able to send messages between nodes.


STOP STEPS:

1. To collect EMANE statistics and GrapeVine delay statistics after sending
 messages with GrapeVine use "./racksuite.py stats"

2. To collect delay statistics, use "./racksuite.py delay"

3. To import EMANE statistics to GvineStatisticDatabase and copy emane statistic
table to the common folder: (./integrated  logfilecopy   “number of nodes”
imports the drop packet time to sql db), imports the emane stats to common
directory

4. To download all statistics and log files to your local machine : (./integrated
get  “complete path to the destination folder”. 

5. To stop EMANE (./integrated  emane_stop  “EMANE folder number”)

6. To delete files and wipe out the system to start new run: ( ./integrated
delete  “EMANE folder number”)

7. TO PLOT run query.py -> merge.py
