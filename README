Description: README for rackspace + emane testing


START STEPS:

1. Create cloud instances on rackspace
- Command: "python3 racksuite.py init"
- Will prompt for a save file created from web app, then
  automatically generate the number of nodes necessary
- Will take some time (~5 minutes)

2. Setup topography configuration
- Command: "python3 racksuite.py setup"
- Will automatically generate the topography and distribute to rackspace nodes
- Will take about a minute

3. Start Emane and GrapeVine on each cloud instance on rackspace 
- Command: "python3 racksuite.py start"
- Will automatically start emane on each rackspace node
- May take up to 30 seconds before nodes can ping eachother

4. Success! You should now be able to send messages between nodes.

START STEPS:

1. Create cloud instances on rackspace
- Command: "python3 racksuite.py init"
- Will create # of rackspace nodes according to save file in config.py
- Will take some time (~5 minutes)

2. Setup topography configuration
- Command: "python3 racksuite.py setup"
- Will automatically generate the topography and distribute to rackspace nodes
- Will take about a minute

3. Start Emane and GrapeVine on each cloud instance on rackspace
- Command: "python3 racksuite.py start"
- Will automatically start emane on each rackspace node
- May take up to 30 seconds before nodes can ping eachother

4. Send a message from node 1
- Command: "python3 racksuite.py message"
- Will prompt for message name and message size

5. Success! You should now be able to send messages between nodes.

STOP STEPS:

1. Stop GrapeVine and Emane
- Command: "python3 racksuite.py stop"

2. Gather event data from nodes
- Command: "python3 racksuite.py stats_events"
- This will merge all of the events from each node into a single sqlite3 database located at
./stats/<save_file>/<timestamp>

3. Get transfer delays from sqlite3 databases
- Command: "python3 racksuite.py transferdelay"
